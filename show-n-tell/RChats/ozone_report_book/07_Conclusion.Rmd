## Conclusion

I read this https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/usage.html to learn how to knit my chapters together to build this book.

Dorian's primer on making a simple book for our TidyTuesdays is terrific. Follow that for your first book! https://github.com/MPCA-data/tidytuesdays/tree/master/show-n-tell/make_book
