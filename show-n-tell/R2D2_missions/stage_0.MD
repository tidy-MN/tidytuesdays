**Credentials**

1.  At the top of your R script
      - Use `#` to add a comment with today’s date
2.  Droid name
      - Create a new object called `nickname`
      - Use it to store your droid’s name as a text string with 3-6 characters
3.  Model type
      - Create an object called `droid_model`
      - Save the name of the droid model you would like *(e.g. "R2D2" or "BB8")*
4.  Home world
      - Create a new variable called `home`
      - Save the name of your home planet to it
5.  Flag color
      - Create a new variable called `flag`
      - Choose a web hex `#`color from [here](https://htmlcolorcodes.com/) or an R color from [here](https://www.r-graph-gallery.com/42-colors-names.html)
      - Store the color name or hex code in the variable `flag`
6.  Use `rm()` to drop the variable `home` from memory
