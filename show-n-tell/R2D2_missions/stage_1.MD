> It happened again. Foolhardy Luke has gotten himself into a pickle all by himself. This time he's stuck in a wampa cave and hanging upside down no less. And we were so looking forward to taking a nice nap while recharging our batteries. That will have to wait.

> Lucky for Luke, I did just bump into a researcher at the cantina recently. They weren't happy about spilling their peas, but were pleased I agreed to help with their study. She mentioned she had been observing the movement patterns of wampas in the area. I think if we do a little data digging we could find an optimum time to rescue Luke. And if we're wrong, well, we won't be the one sneaking into the cave to find out.

## Your Mission

- What hour of the day is the Wampa most likely to be absent from their cave?


### Required packages

```r
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
```

### Setup

- In RStudio, create a new project called `wampa`.

### Instructions

0. Download the 2 Excel files from [Wampa data](https://github.com/MPCA-data/tidytuesdays/tree/master/show-n-tell/R2D2_missions/stage_1_data)
    - Click the file name.
    - Click the `[ Download ]` button near the lower right-hand side.
    - Save directly to or move the files to a folder named `data` in your project folder.
1. Open each Excel file and save it as a.CSV file *(later on we'll learn how to read data directly from Excel & other data sources)*
    - <img src="https://cdn4syt-solveyourtech.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/excel-2013-save-as-csv-4.jpg" width="50%" >
    - Save the 2 CSV files to your project's `data` folder.
    - Keep clicking `Yes` if Excel trys to warn you about...losing formatting...yada-yada...
2. Read each of the CSV files into R using `read_csv()`
3. Use `bind_rows()` to combine the 2 data sets into a single table:
    - `all_data <- bind_rows(week1, week2)`
    - *This will be your super "ALL the data" table*
4. Use `summary()` to find the hour of day with the highest amount of **"time_spent_out_hunting"**. 
    - Hopefully Luke was caught by a very predictable wampa.

**Final step:** Clap 5 times.  :clap::clap::clap::clap::clap: Out loud. For real. We are watching.
