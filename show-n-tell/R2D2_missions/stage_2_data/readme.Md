# AT-AT Radio Frequencies ðŸ“» 

This file is meant to contain the documented radio frequencies used by the Empire's AT walkers on planet Hoth. We are not exactly sure on the details, but R2D2 managed to barter with another droid for the data and promised some unknown compensation in return. From first glance this file looks full of a bunch of random noise, but hopefully someone can make some sense of it - and soon. 

*Hmmm...  In hindsight, this may not have been the best of plans.*
