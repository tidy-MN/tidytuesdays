## Top Packages of 2024
The packages listed here are not in any order other than the order in which the author read them. Many of the write-ups and suggestions were pulled from [Top 25 R Packages you need to learn in 2024](https://www.r-bloggers.com/2024/08/top-25-r-packages-you-need-to-learn-in-2024/)
1. [`striprtf`](https://github.com/kota7/striprtf) - Extract Text from RTF (Rich Text Format) File. This package comes in handy when you need it!
1. [`tidylog`](https://github.com/elbersb/tidylog) - Will give you helpful feedback messages anytime you run a dplyr function like filter() or mutate(), such as letting you know how many rows were dropped or how many values were changed to NA. Make sure to load the library after tidyverse for the magic to work.
1. [`here`](https://here.r-lib.org/) - "The here package enables easy file referencing by using the top-level directory of a file project to easily build file paths." With this I don't have to type in my file path within R file, which is a pain. I learned about this library when I read the [project-oriented workflow](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2017/12/workflow-vs-script/).
2. [`janitor`](https://sfirke.github.io/janitor/articles/janitor.html) - no list would be complete without this data-cleaning workhorse. From `clean_names` to `get_dupes`, it really does it all.
3. [`renv`](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html) - Package management and reproducibility are critical aspects of any data project. `renv` helps by keeping track of the packages and versions used in a project, ensuring that your work is reproducible across different environments.
4. [`gt`](https://gt.rstudio.com/) - With the `gt` package, anyone can make wonderful-looking tables using the R programming language. The `gt` philosophy: we can construct a wide variety of useful tables with a cohesive set of table parts.

## New packages to Explore in 2025
