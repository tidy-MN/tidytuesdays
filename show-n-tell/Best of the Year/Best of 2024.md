## Top Packages of 2024
The packages listed here are not in any order other than the order in which the author read them. Many of the write-ups and suggestions were pulled from [Top 25 R Packages you need to learn in 2024](https://www.r-bloggers.com/2024/08/top-25-r-packages-you-need-to-learn-in-2024/)
1. [`striprtf`](https://github.com/kota7/striprtf) - Extract Text from RTF (Rich Text Format) File. This package comes in handy when you need it!
1. [`tidylog`](https://github.com/elbersb/tidylog) - Will give you helpful feedback messages anytime you run a dplyr function like filter() or mutate(), such as letting you know how many rows were dropped or how many values were changed to NA. Make sure to load the library after tidyverse for the magic to work.
1. [`here`](https://here.r-lib.org/) - "The here package enables easy file referencing by using the top-level directory of a file project to easily build file paths." With this I don't have to type in my file path within R file, which is a pain. I learned about this library when I read the [project-oriented workflow](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2017/12/workflow-vs-script/).
2. [`janitor`](https://sfirke.github.io/janitor/articles/janitor.html) - no list would be complete without this data-cleaning workhorse. From `clean_names` to `get_dupes`, it really does it all.
3. [`renv`](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html) - Package management and reproducibility are critical aspects of any data project. `renv` helps by keeping track of the packages and versions used in a project, ensuring that your work is reproducible across different environments.
4. [`gt`](https://gt.rstudio.com/) - With the `gt` package, anyone can make wonderful-looking tables using the R programming language. The `gt` philosophy: we can construct a wide variety of useful tables with a cohesive set of table parts.
5. [`fcuk`](https://github.com/ThinkR-open/fcuk) - A package designed to help people with clumsy fingers.
6. [`patchwork`](https://patchwork.data-imaginist.com/) - When you’re working with multiple `ggplot2` plots, `patchwork` makes it easy to combine them into a single cohesive graphic. This package is perfect for creating complex layouts and multi-panel plots.
7. [`stringr`](https://stringr.tidyverse.org/) - Strings are not glamorous, high-profile components of R, but they do play a big role in many data cleaning and preparation tasks. The stringr package provides a cohesive set of functions designed to make working with strings as easy as possible.
8. [`scales`](https://scales.r-lib.org/) - One of the most difficult parts of any graphics package is scaling, converting from data values to perceptual properties. The inverse of scaling, making guides (legends and axes) that can be used to read the graph, is often even harder! The `scales` packages provides the internal scaling infrastructure used by `ggplot2`, and gives you tools to override the default breaks, labels, transformations and palettes.

## New packages to Explore in 2025
1. [`clock`](https://clock.r-lib.org/index.html) - `clock` takes date and time manipulation to the next level, offering a robust alternative to the popular `lubridate` package. It provides more powerful and precise tools for working with dates and times, making it a valuable addition to any R user’s toolkit.
2. [`fs`](https://fs.r-lib.org/) - The `fs` package simplifies working with the file system in R. It provides a consistent and user-friendly interface for tasks like file management, directory navigation, and handling file paths, making it easier to automate workflows involving files.
3. [`furrr`](https://furrr.futureverse.org/index.html) - The `furrr` package combines the power of `purrr` with the parallel processing capabilities of the `future` library. It enables you to perform iterative tasks in parallel, significantly speeding up computations.
4. [`correlationfunnel`](https://business-science.github.io/correlationfunnel/) - designed to help you understand the relationships between variables in your data. It provides tools to quickly visualize and analyze correlations, turning them into actionable insights that can drive decision-making.
5. [`naniar`](https://naniar.njtierney.com/) - Handling missing data is a common challenge in data analysis, and `naniar` provides an elegant solution. The package offers powerful visualization tools to help you understand and manage missing values in your datasets.
6. [`GWalkR`](https://github.com/Kanaries/GWalkR) - For those who love the interactivity and visual power of Tableau, `GWalkR` brings similar capabilities into the R environment. It enables exploratory data analysis with interactive graphics directly from R, making it easier to understand complex data through visual exploration.
7. [`lintr`](https://lintr.r-lib.org/index.html) - `lintr` provides [static code analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_program_analysis) for R. It checks for adherence to a given style, identifying syntax errors and possible semantic issues, then reports them to you so you can take action.
8. [`librarian`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/librarian/vignettes/intro-to-librarian.html) - `librarian` merges CRAN, GitHub, and Bioconductor package installation and management into one consistent interface, which means that you can deal with packages in your code without breaking your train of thought.
9. [`skimr`](https://github.com/ropensci/skimr) - `skimr` provides a frictionless approach to summary statistics which conforms to the [principle of least surprise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_astonishment), displaying summary statistics the user can skim quickly to understand their data. It handles different data types and returns a `skim_df` object which can be included in a pipeline or displayed nicely for the human reader.
10. [`box`](https://github.com/klmr/box) - Code doesn’t have to be wrapped into an R package to be reusable. With `box`, regular R files are reusable R modules that can be used elsewhere.
